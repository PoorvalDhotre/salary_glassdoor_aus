Role Description & Responsibilities

Role Description & Responsibilities

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Summary

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is a key player in the Australian security landscape that rises to complex challenges and respond swiftly to protect Australians as new threats emerge. The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

This recruitment activity is aiming to fulfil multiple positions requiring differing skillsets, if you feel like you have something to offer, we encourage you to apply.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Summary

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is a key player in the Australian security landscape that rises to complex challenges and respond swiftly to protect Australians as new threats emerge. The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

The AFP has embarked on a initiative to use information and data to proactively identify and disrupt criminal activity, and is seeking multiple high quality data analysts, data engineers and data scientists to join the AFP’s Chief Data Officer branch and assist in developing this vision. These roles will directly contribute to the development of AFP’s disruptive capabilities, and to assist the AFP in dynamically combating crime in the digital age. This recruitment activity is aiming to fulfil multiple positions requiring differing skillsets, if you feel like you have something to offer, we encourage you to apply.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

As a Team Member in the AFP you will be required to contribute to the achievement of outcomes in accordance with the regulatory framework, the AFP Code of Conduct and the AFP Governance Instruments.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Summary

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is a key player in the Australian security landscape that rises to complex challenges and respond swiftly to protect Australians as new threats emerge. The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

If you are passionate in your role as a senior data specialist, and want to make a real difference to Australia’s security and policing future, we want to hear from you!

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

The roles are part of a small section supporting a highly tactical and operational organisation. We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload. This gives our team members great opportunity to both broaden and deepen their skills in today's data challenges across many domains and technologies. While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis.

Role Description & Responsibilities

Role Summary

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is a key player in the Australian security landscape that rises to complex challenges and respond swiftly to protect Australians as new threats emerge. The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

The AFP has embarked on a initiative to use information and data to proactively identify and disrupt criminal activity, and is seeking multiple high quality data analysts, data engineers and data scientists to join the AFP’s Chief Data Officer branch and assist in developing this vision. These roles will directly contribute to the development of AFP’s disruptive capabilities, and to assist the AFP in dynamically combating crime in the digital age. This recruitment activity is aiming to fulfil multiple positions requiring differing skillsets, if you feel like you have something to offer, we encourage you to apply.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

As a Team Member in the AFP you will be required to contribute to the achievement of outcomes in accordance with the regulatory framework, the AFP Code of Conduct and the AFP Governance Instruments. It is expected that the successful applicant will deliver on the core responsibilities and meet any requirements of the position as outlined below.

If you are passionate in your role as a senior data specialist, and want to make a real difference to Australia’s security and policing future, we want to hear from you!

Role Description & Responsibilities

We are looking for individuals with experience in one or more of the following specialities: data science, data engineering and/or data analysis. The roles are jointly responsible for developing new capabilities, responding to complex data challenges and performing complex data analyses using advanced analytics technologies.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.
