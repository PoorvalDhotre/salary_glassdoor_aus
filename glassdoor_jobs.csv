The AFP’s responsibility is to investigate, prevent and disrupt transnational, complex and organised crime; including terrorism, cybercrime, extremism, drug smuggling and human trafficking. The AFP is also responsible for policing in the ACT and other Australian dependent territories, providing protective security for politicians, embassy staff and dignitaries, United Nations peacekeeping and acting as Australia’s international law enforcement representative.

The AFP has embarked on a initiative to use information and data to proactively identify and disrupt criminal activity, and is seeking multiple high quality data analysts, data engineers and data scientists to join the AFP’s Chief Data Officer branch and assist in developing this vision. These roles will directly contribute to the development of AFP’s disruptive capabilities, and to assist the AFP in dynamically combating crime in the digital age. This recruitment activity is aiming to fulfil multiple positions requiring differing skillsets, if you feel like you have something to offer, we encourage you to apply.

The successful candidate(s) will provide expert consultancy within their area of specialism and develop and promote technical analytical solutions which support the business requirements of the AFP.

We run self-sufficient teams where we have all the skills to develop and operate our data capabilities in the team and use scrum to help structure and manage our workload.

While roles recruited through this process will be primarily responsible for one of three specialities: data science, data engineering, or data analysis; we also expect our members to jump in and help the broader team when operational demands hit. We recognise that no candidate is going have experience with all the technologies we use, so instead we’re looking for people with a demonstrated ability to learn and adapt quickly to business demands and technological changes. As such, we’re looking for anyone who sees themselves in any of those roles, or a combination of them.

Role Description & Responsibilities
